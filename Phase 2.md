Based on our workflows, we have identified the following important entity data types: Medication: which contains administration records of medication orders and intravenous medications [1]. Billing: Data that has been coded and is primarily used for billing and administrative purposes [1]. ICD-10 codes are one example of such data. Information about the author: Demographic data, admission and discharge timings, and death dates [1]. Dictionaries: Look-up tables with related definitions for cross-referencing identifiers (e.g., codes) [1]. Interventions include dialysis, imaging investigations, and line installation [1]. Blood chemistry, hematology, urine analysis, and microbiological test findings [1] are examples of laboratory measures. Notes: These are free-text notes such as provider evaluation and progress notes, as well as hospital discharge reports [1]. Physiologic data: Hourly nurse-verified vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate) [1]. Reports: Reports of electrocardiograms and imaging investigations (x-ray, computed tomography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging) in free text [1].

The patient care flow processes that we wanted to continue with are the provider to patient medication administration, clinical assessment and documentation, and admissions and discharge.

Electronic medication administration record (E-MAR) is a system that streamlines documentation of medication administration into the approved electronic health record (EHR) utilizing electronic tracking sensors (such as radio frequency identification (RFID) or electronically readable tagging such as barcoding) [2]. Medication mistakes can be reduced with E-MAR. This ensures that staff gives the correct medication, amount, route, and time for the correct resident while minimizing the chance of mistakes or delays throughout the distribution process [3]. The process of our E-MAR includes a barcoding system that assists personnel in identifying residents prior to giving medicine. E-MAR can also improve efficiency by reducing administrative load [3]. The E-MAR allows care professionals to order and deliver drugs more effectively, eliminating the need for burdensome paper prescription orders [4]. E-MAR can also execute medication passes in a timely and efficient manner. It will improve patients' and healthcare professionals' performance and quality outcomes by offering a quick and easy approach to conducting medication passes and completing the accompanying paperwork [5]. The E-MAR barcoding will help healthcare providers plan jobs and track time to guarantee timely and accurate drug dispensing. Access pharmaceutical pictures, interaction warnings, and drug information sheets with ease; also automated workflow prompts ensure the collection of supporting documentation, such as vitals and progress notes [3,5].

Clinical Assessment and Documentation are necessary components of patient care. It provides a record of patient visits to track trends in health status, determines necessary changes needed to be made to a patient’s plan of care between providers and healthcare institutions, and captures reimbursement at the end of the visit to make sure the healthcare institution is appropriately paid for the visit. Re-designing this workflow can improve the process of evaluating and treating patients using the EHR, specifically in the following areas: (1) chart review, (2) ordering relevant tests, referrals, and medications, (3) documenting the patient visit, and (4) placing charges for reimbursement. In understanding and optimizing this experience, we can decrease clinician burnout due to documentation burden and promote patient safety and satisfaction with timely and effective clinical services, thereby improving our va

Admissions and Discharge is the period between a Participant's admission to a hospital as a bed patient and the termination of bed-patient treatment or discharge by the admitting Physician or Professional Other Provider, whichever occurs first is the admissions and discharge [6]. A successful redesign approach can help to increase efficiency, minimize chaos, and improve the quality and safety of health care. Various obstacles and inefficiencies might be detected during the workflow redesign process. A new map can be created using the information and ensuring that the new workflow aligns with the capabilities of the organization's EHR. A workflow redesign approach will enable organizations to assess their current workflows and address any concerns. The data can then be used to restructure the workflow, removing duplication. Effective workflow management has been shown to reduce the likelihood of errors, help in maintaining adherence to quality rules such as HIPAA, and increase the quality of treatment accessibility to healthcare [7].
