In keeping pace with healthcare and technological advances, our institution must follow suit to provide the best patient care and be appropriately reimbursed for it to maintain our financial solvency. We have come to a junction in our institution's development where our legacy electronic health record system (EHR) system has become outdated and has become a significant liability to our future. Thus far, we have begun the implementation of a new EHR system and require further support from the entire institution. Below you’ll find further information required to execute a successful EHR implementation.

Business Plan

The newly implemented EHR will: Reduce the usage of paper altogether and increase the use of electronic information, cut expenses by simplifying, streamlining, and automating operations, and improve patient care and safety because of care coordination. Our goal is to provide stakeholders (e.g., C-suite, providers, patients, etc.) with an all-inclusive electronic health record that will facilitate information sharing, care coordination, and interoperability across the medical facility. In doing so we aim to implement a scalable EHR to adapt to changes in healthcare policy, patient population, health conditions, and community needs. Our timeline to reach a successful implementation and execution of an EHR system are as follows:

We want to develop, execute, and show the capacity to adapt to the evolving information and data analysis demands of stakeholders, health care professionals, research scientists, and educators. We want to obtain and exhibit a technological understanding of EHRs that will have a direct impact in the hospital with factors in storage, retrieval, and analysis. We want to assist healthcare professionals in developing an interest in EHR practices and career development; and explain the significance of HIPAA and HITECH, as well as its applications to the meaningful use of the EHR and incentives.

Needed changes for improvement

Needed changes to the system require every department to be notified of the upcoming changes through email, department meetings, and in-services at every major phase of the project, as needed. We must treat each person working within the hospital and relevant affiliates that have a stake in our success to be involved in the change in EHR as it is one of the most important parts of any hospital/health system. Once department heads have met and discussed the proposed timeline with the implementation team there will be simultaneous events that will occur in conjunction with purchasing, IT department, and relevant administration there will be the pricing of software/hardware components with vendors contacted to do so; building maintenance services meet with contractors and department heads to discuss infrastructure plans and changes. Meeting between IT department, EHR vendors, software/hardware vendors, radiology (PACS administrators), clinical analysts, compliance, and relevant department heads regarding data migration from legacy to the new EHR system.

Key Components of HCIS

Strategic planning consists of allocating the appropriate resources to the right places in as efficient a manner as possible to allow for a seamless transition from phase to phase, decrease room for error (saving money, time, effort/labor), and maintain patient and provider satisfaction. The concepts related to strategic planning involve (1) foundational infrastructure - our current network capabilities, security, data processing environment, connectivity, MPI definition. Understanding what we must know how to move forward (2) basic core systems - understanding our current and future business, analytical, clinical, and reporting systems involve, what is needed, and what can reasonably be accomplished, and (3) advanced capabilities utilizing enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, and predictive analytics to determine areas of change, adaptation, and testing scalability. And within these stages are the following phases: (i) planning (ii) development/selection, (iii) implementation into production, and (iv) ongoing support and evaluation.

The executive leadership of the hospital must provide unwavering support and sponsorship. Changes in corporate culture are required for the initial adoption and continuing optimization of health IT. We think that is vital to provide regular updates to senior leadership and ensure knowledge of the existing and future condition of health information systems [1]. This will enable them to convey clearly and repeatedly that using the HIS is an organizational necessity, not just an IT initiative [1]. The organization's dedication to improving results and reducing damage cannot be emphasized.

The newly implemented HER will be very challenging for physicians, who may regard adopting new technology and learning a new method of doing things as inefficient or as taking time away from the business of treating patients [2]. This is when clinical leadership comes into play. Clinical leadership engagement is necessary to assist negotiate the changes in technology and workflow that come with health information technology integration [2]. Clinical leaders understand their colleagues' issues and can assist in gaining acceptance for the many judgments that are made [2]. We believe that including leaders from various backgrounds in their use of technology increases credibility. It is critical to involve health IT professionals, but it is equally if not more critical to include typical users in the leadership circle. To deal with the various challenges that emerge throughout the usual process of HIT adoption and optimization, a solid governance framework is required [3]. Stakeholders must understand how choices are made to establish trust in the system and its leaders. A fully established mechanism for change control is included in governance [3].

Patient care flow process with a description

eMAR - is a system that streamlines documentation of medication administration into the approved EHR utilizing electronic tracking sensors (such as radio frequency identification (RFID) or electronically readable tagging such as barcoding) [4]. Medication Administration Record (eMAR) - (1) (start) Provider receives medication report, (2) Does the patient need medication from the Pyxis?, (3+4) Obtain medication from Pyxis Medstation + Provider enters a patient room with mask and PPE, (5) Provider access EHR, checks, then scan patient wrist ID, (6) Provider reviews patient medication/s to report, (7) Are any of the patient's medication missing?, (8+9) Send Request/Call pharmacy or Check Pyxis Medstation + Is Patient to Medication Assessment Needed?, (10) Provider performs the assessment, (11) Provider scans patient's medications, prepares and administers the meds, (12) Provider documents the medication in the EHR, (13+14) Double Check if Patient requires more meds + Provider closes medication box and sterilizes equipment, (15+16) Provider documents post-administrative procedure in a patient room or hallway + Provider moves on to the next patient (end). 

Clinical Assessment and Documentation - Clinical documentation is a necessary component of patient care. It provides a record of patient visits to track trends in health status and to determine necessary changes needing to be made to a patient’s plan of care between providers and healthcare institutions. (1) (start) Health provider checks schedule or looks for consult received under orders, (2) (decision) Provider acknowledges order/consult, (3)  (process) Provider conducts chart review within EHR, (4) (decision) Orders preliminary tests based on chart review (5) (decision) Orders post-visit tests based on physical examination, (6) (process) Enters appropriate window/tab/section for documentation, (7) (process) Documents visit, diagnosis, and recommendations and then electronically signs the note, and (8) (decision) Navigates to billing/charges section and places charges for the visit.

Admissions and Discharge - The period between a Participant's admission to a hospital as a bed patient and the termination of bed-patient treatment or discharge by the admitting Physician or Professional Other Provider, whichever occurs first is the admissions and discharge [5]. Admissions and Discharge in ED 1. Patient arrives at the ED by walk-in/ambulance 2. Is patient registered 3. If not, the patient is registered at desk 3. Nurse triages 4. The physician assesses 5. Does the patient need a lab/radiology order? 6. If yes, the Laboratory/Radiology order is put in 7. Treatment by Physician 7. The decision to admit or discharge a patient.

Data entity types related to patient care:

With the new EHR implementation, it will be composed of standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs), electronic exchange of clinical care documentation, and other standards-based processes such as e-prescribing, which will, in turn, increase care coordination [6]. Meaningful use and compliance with the Office of National Coordinator will ensure that a health IT module will execute clinical care and data exchange tasks in compliance with interoperability standards and user-centered design. The main advantages of standard data gathering, and interoperable information transmission will include increased patient safety, usability, privacy, and security [6]. Health Information Exchange provides the potential to develop multi-layered datasets across many contexts. 

We agreed on data entity types which include Patient and Provider-centered: all prospective and retrospective data from new patients and clinicians/healthcare providers. Cross-sectional: all data and analytics that focuses on many patients, healthcare providers, administration, billing, pharmacy, etc. across a certain period. This can be used to generate unique insights in those listed above, from clinical trials to other quantitative studies like comparative metrics, return on investment/debt, and operational efficiency [7]. Longitudinal: all data and analysis that was collected sequentially through a series of repeated observations from the same patients, healthcare providers, administration, billing, pharmacy, etc. to assess change [7].

Workflow Redesign Team and Users

The workflow redesign team includes the Project Manager, Application Developer, Physician and Nurse Advocate, IT, QA Technician, and Meaningful use administrator. The new EHR implementation is designed to enhance communication and better patient care and safety with known healthcare providers such as nurses, physicians, and physician associates [8]. Also, in collaboration with other specialties in the hospital, such as laboratories, allied health specialties, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency rooms, rehabilitation, outpatient clinic, etc.

Timeline 

○      Selection of EHR implementation team

○      Strategic Planning (4-6 months)

○      Design (4-6 months)

○      Build & Test (6-8 months)

○      Ongoing Support, System Maintenance, Evaluation, and Interoperability (4 months)

○      Training & Activation (2-3 months)

○      Post-Go-Live (Ongoing)

Hospital System Requirements and Current Hospital Workflows

Government regulatory requirements and compliance, such as meaningful use and patient access to the portal. Updated technology that is easy to use and is low-cost to maintain. The hospital needs a new system that will facilitate a better workflow that will be more efficient and effective for their clinical processes, especially medication administration.

These are the current problems in the legacy/paper-based system:

Clinical Documentation: each time a patient is admitted, a new chart must be created, the chart must be accompanied by the patient throughout the hospital, and there is always a possibility of it being misplaced or stolen.

Communications between departments in the hospitals: For revisions to medical records between departments, they must fax or courier the information back and forth.

Communications with outside providers: Referrals and Prescriptions are typed/written by hand and must be properly tracked.

Hospital/Patient Billing: After every patient is discharged, the charge sheets must be manually input into the billing system, taking care to ensure that the right CPT and ICD-10, and prescription codes are recorded. This information must then be reviewed by medical billing and coding staff before being submitted to third-party insurance and patients through mail/fax.

EHR Vendor Selection Process and Hi-Fi prototype

Determine high-priority requirements and EHR features that may be able to address them. Make sure of the EHR features that need to meet your practice's goals for meaningful use. All types of stakeholders should be considered throughout the selection process. These should comprise a physician, nurse, support personnel, and a practice management representative who is knowledgeable with the billing process [9]. A project manager should be appointed to oversee the process and keep track of deadlines and costs. The goal of implementing an EHR system is to achieve meaningful use and improve treatment. Some of the functionalities we wanted within the EHR are CPOE (computerized physician order entry), eMAR (electronic medication administration record), E-prescribing, decision support tools, etc. We were also prepared to rate the EHR demonstration and provide speakers with use cases relevant to the hospital. The selection committee will have a consistent measurement instrument to gauge how suppliers differ in their responses to the scenarios using these [9]. Afterward, we would check vendor references and rate the vendors. Finally, we schedule site visits, choose a finalist, and begin contract negotiations.

For the high-fidelity prototype, we will be implementing our creation of the EHR, using Wix, which is a software that allows us to utilize online drag-and-drop tools to develop HTML5 web pages and mobile sites in conjunction with Velo API (JavaScript and CSS based).
